Concept:
	Your are 2 players who explore a vast, world where puzzles are everywhere. The puzzle world is made in a layerd manner, and based on tiles, as well as tile based movement. You need to solve them to find out who exactly you are.

Gameplay:
	The gameplay will be filled with puzzle solving, kinda in the Legend of Zelda style. The puzzles will be varied by having power ups that change the way the character acts. This power ups will be represented by colored orbs. 
	The following orbs exist:
		Red orb: Gives you a red orb that can be thrown and then returns to you.
		Blue orb: lets you toggle your weight on and off, making you press or not press buttons.
		Yellow orb: Allows you to jump up one layer. 

	Only one orb can be active at any time, meaning the power-up is overiden. 
	The gameplay will be focused on co-op between you and your companion. Some of the puzzles include, draging boxes, avoiding traps, and solving puzzles.
